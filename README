cws2fws
CWS to FWS Flash file Decompressor

cws2fws is a short Perl script I wrote to convert CWS compressed Flash v. >= 6 files to FWS files. Motivation for this was to be able to use the SWF::Search module which currently does not open compressed CWS files.

How does it work?

It is as simple as it can get. cws2fws FILENAME.swf reads the first 8 bytes of FILENAME.swf substituting the CWS header for FWS. it then reads from byte 9 to EOF decompressing the stream via the zlib uncompress interface. the resulting decompressed stream and the new FWS header are then concatenated to output a FILENAME.fws.swf
